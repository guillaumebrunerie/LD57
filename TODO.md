- shooting arrows in mobile is difficult
- win music? (try playing GameOver)
- fix hitboxes
- should not be able to shoot while dead
- make music loop
- compressing images automatically
- remove timer
- clouds slowly moving in start screen
- fix impossible patterns in balancing + maybe more variety at the beginning

Waiting for art:

- flapping wings
- animated foreground in some levels
- add different obstacles for different levels (but same shape)
- win posting ("the end")
- hit animation (feathers)
- fix sides that do not match
